🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis

This project explores historical climate data to uncover patterns and correlations between environmental factors such as forest area, temperature, CO₂ concentration, and disaster frequency over time.
----

📌 Project Summary
Duration: Apr 2024 – May 2024

Role: Individual Project

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn


🎯 Objectives
Analyze environmental changes across years and regions.

Detect trends and possible correlations between climate-related indicators.

Visualize climate dynamics interactively.


📊 Key Features
✅ Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values.

Applied Min-Max scaling by region.

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis:

Created Boxplots and QQ-plots to evaluate data distributions.

Designed heatmaps and interactive line charts using Plotly.

✅ Statistical & Signal Processing Techniques:

Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce dimensionality.

Used Fourier Transform to examine temporal frequency patterns.


📈 Visualization Highlights
📌 Interactive Line Chart: Shows trends in forest area, temperature, CO₂ concentration, and disaster frequency.

📌 Heatmap: Visualizes correlation between climate indicators.

📌 Boxplot & QQ Plot: Distribution and normality checks for key variables.
